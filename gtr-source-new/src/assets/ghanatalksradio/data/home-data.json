One would also not be permitted to win the sympathy of the court by alleging fraud against his adversary without proving same beyond reasonable doubt.”<br><br>The land owner, the said Adolf Tetteh said the disputed parcel of land is covered by Land Title Certificate No. GA. 464555 and dated 26 February 2015 and added a copy of the Title Certificate and the indenture covering the land to the court.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh informed the court his Sub-lessor has also always been in effective possession of the land and had registered it in 2007 under Land Title Certificate No. GA26393.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Sub-lessor also acquired the land with Title Certificate No. GA 19310 with photocopies of the said Land Title Certificate No. GA 19310 and Land Title Certificate No. GA 25462 all presented in court.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh said Anas Aremeyaw Anas’ claim of customary grant of the land to him by a certain Ga family was “merely a ploy to deceive the court”.<br><br>The Plaintiff told the court that Anas showed up one day and “caused a signpost to be erected on the land with the inscription “Tiger Eye Property. Keep off” and also employed the services of land guards to purportedly provide security for his unlawful construction works.”<br><br><strong>Court Ruling</strong><br><br>The court ordered Anas Aremeyaw Anas to vacate the disputed land and to pay Ghs60,000 in general damages and Ghs40,000 in legal cost to Adolf Tetteh who adduced evidence to prove he acquired the land legally and was about to build when Anas Aremeyaw Anas showed up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The court said it was perpetually restraining Anas Aremeyaw Anas, “his servants, agents, assigns, workmen and all those claiming through him from entering, carrying out any construction works or interfering with all that piece or parcel of land in any manner whatsoever or disturbing the Plaintiff’s peaceful occupation and possession of same”<br><br><strong>Tiger Eye P.I Property Controversy In Court</strong><br><br>Anas Aremeyaw Anas filed a motion to oppose the inclusion of Tiger Eye P.I in the suit as it was not an owner of the property but the plaintiff resisted and said Tiger Eye P.I should be in the suit.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh told the court when Anas seized the land in dispute, Anas caused to be erected a signpost on the land saying “Property of Tiger Eye P.I Keep Off”. According to Adolf Tetteh that is why he added the company to the court case because the signpost said his land was being claimed by Tiger Eye.<br><br>The court removed Tiger Eye from the suit while the second defendand sued with Anas failed to enter appearance or show up. The second defendant, Holy Quaye, is the person Anas claimed to have bought the land from.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“From the evidence, the Plaintiff was in possession of the land until the 1st Defendant blazingly entered same and started construction day and night with the help of the Police and land guards.

KEEP OFF. When an application was brought to join “TIGER EYE PI” to this suit, he resisted claiming the said entity has no interest in the land. His claim to the disputed land has no basis in law and in fact.<br><br>Trespass is an injury against possession, hence the 1st Defendant is liable.

One would also not be permitted to win the sympathy of the court by alleging fraud against his adversary without proving same beyond reasonable doubt.”<br><br>The land owner, the said Adolf Tetteh said the disputed parcel of land is covered by Land Title Certificate No. GA. 464555 and dated 26 February 2015 and added a copy of the Title Certificate and the indenture covering the land to the court.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh informed the court his Sub-lessor has also always been in effective possession of the land and had registered it in 2007 under Land Title Certificate No. GA26393.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Sub-lessor also acquired the land with Title Certificate No. GA 19310 with photocopies of the said Land Title Certificate No. GA 19310 and Land Title Certificate No. GA 25462 all presented in court.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh said Anas Aremeyaw Anas’ claim of customary grant of the land to him by a certain Ga family was “merely a ploy to deceive the court”.<br><br>The Plaintiff told the court that Anas showed up one day and “caused a signpost to be erected on the land with the inscription “Tiger Eye Property. Keep off” and also employed the services of land guards to purportedly provide security for his unlawful construction works.”<br><br><strong>Court Ruling</strong><br><br>The court ordered Anas Aremeyaw Anas to vacate the disputed land and to pay Ghs60,000 in general damages and Ghs40,000 in legal cost to Adolf Tetteh who adduced evidence to prove he acquired the land legally and was about to build when Anas Aremeyaw Anas showed up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The court said it was perpetually restraining Anas Aremeyaw Anas, “his servants, agents, assigns, workmen and all those claiming through him from entering, carrying out any construction works or interfering with all that piece or parcel of land in any manner whatsoever or disturbing the Plaintiff’s peaceful occupation and possession of same”<br><br><strong>Tiger Eye P.I Property Controversy In Court</strong><br><br>Anas Aremeyaw Anas filed a motion to oppose the inclusion of Tiger Eye P.I in the suit as it was not an owner of the property but the plaintiff resisted and said Tiger Eye P.I should be in the suit.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh told the court when Anas seized the land in dispute, Anas caused to be erected a signpost on the land saying “Property of Tiger Eye P.I Keep Off”. According to Adolf Tetteh that is why he added the company to the court case because the signpost said his land was being claimed by Tiger Eye.<br><br>The court removed Tiger Eye from the suit while the second defendand sued with Anas failed to enter appearance or show up. The second defendant, Holy Quaye, is the person Anas claimed to have bought the land from.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“From the evidence, the Plaintiff was in possession of the land until the 1st Defendant blazingly entered same and started construction day and night with the help of the Police and land guards. The structures he erected on the land is clearly unauthorized. Any prudent purchaser is required to do due diligence before acquisition but in this case the 1st Defendant from the evidence did none.<br><br>He entered the land and erected a signpost on the land with the inscription “PROPERTY OF TIGER EYE. KEEP OFF. When an application was brought to join “TIGER EYE PI” to this suit, he resisted claiming the said entity has no interest in the land. His claim to the disputed land has no basis in law and in fact.<br><br>Trespass is an injury against possession, hence the 1st Defendant is liable. In trespass, damages are at large and there would be the need to award damages to commensurate with the circumstances of this case.\"<br><br>This is the second time in a matter of weeks in which the court has found the investigative journalist liable for one wrong or the other after another court ruled in favour of Kennedy Agyapong against the journalist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Source: mynewsgh</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

One would also not be permitted to win the sympathy of the court by alleging fraud against his adversary without proving same beyond reasonable doubt.”<br><br>The land owner, the said Adolf Tetteh said the disputed parcel of land is covered by Land Title Certificate No. GA. 464555 and dated 26 February 2015 and added a copy of the Title Certificate and the indenture covering the land to the court.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh informed the court his Sub-lessor has also always been in effective possession of the land and had registered it in 2007 under Land Title Certificate No. GA26393.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Sub-lessor also acquired the land with Title Certificate No. GA 19310 with photocopies of the said Land Title Certificate No. GA 19310 and Land Title Certificate No. GA 25462 all presented in court.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh said Anas Aremeyaw Anas’ claim of customary grant of the land to him by a certain Ga family was “merely a ploy to deceive the court”.<br><br>The Plaintiff told the court that Anas showed up one day and “caused a signpost to be erected on the land with the inscription “Tiger Eye Property. Keep off” and also employed the services of land guards to purportedly provide security for his unlawful construction works.”<br><br><strong>Court Ruling</strong><br><br>The court ordered Anas Aremeyaw Anas to vacate the disputed land and to pay Ghs60,000 in general damages and Ghs40,000 in legal cost to Adolf Tetteh who adduced evidence to prove he acquired the land legally and was about to build when Anas Aremeyaw Anas showed up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The court said it was perpetually restraining Anas Aremeyaw Anas, “his servants, agents, assigns, workmen and all those claiming through him from entering, carrying out any construction works or interfering with all that piece or parcel of land in any manner whatsoever or disturbing the Plaintiff’s peaceful occupation and possession of same”<br><br><strong>Tiger Eye P.I Property Controversy In Court</strong><br><br>Anas Aremeyaw Anas filed a motion to oppose the inclusion of Tiger Eye P.I in the suit as it was not an owner of the property but the plaintiff resisted and said Tiger Eye P.I should be in the suit.<br><br>Adolf Tetteh told the court when Anas seized the land in dispute, Anas caused to be erected a signpost on the land saying “Property of Tiger Eye P.I Keep Off”. According to Adolf Tetteh that is why he added the company to the court case because the signpost said his land was being claimed by Tiger Eye.<br><br>The court removed Tiger Eye from the suit while the second defendand sued with Anas failed to enter appearance or show up. The second defendant, Holy Quaye, is the person Anas claimed to have bought the land from.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“From the evidence, the Plaintiff was in possession of the land until the 1st Defendant blazingly entered same and started construction day and night with the help of the Police and land guards. The structures he erected on the land is clearly unauthorized. Any prudent purchaser is required to do due diligence before acquisition but in this case the 1st Defendant from the evidence did none.<br><br>He entered the land and erected a signpost on the land with the inscription “PROPERTY OF TIGER EYE.

Drinking warm water removes congestion in the chest as nasal congestion is a common occurrence in the wet season of the rain, warm water also helps to flush out the mucus in the air passage and lungs giving a soothing relief from sinus and sore throat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":62633,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wordpress.ghanatalksradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hot-drink-next-to-stove-top-kettle-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62633\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When mixed with coffee and teas, hot water has many benefits. Research published in 2017 linked hot coffee consumption to a longer life. Other research has found a link between moderate hot coffee consumption and a reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease, some cancers, type 2 diabetes, some liver disease and heart health problems. Hot teas are known to reduce the risk of stroke, heart disease and liver disease. Studies have also linked consumption of a hot cup of water to reduced stress and anxiety levels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Speaking on the benefits of hot water during the rainy season, a medical practitioner, Dr Bukky Tikare noted that hot water baths have become necessary as it increases blood flow and lowers blood pressure while relaxing the body and putting it in sleep mode. According to her, hot water baths during the rainy season also helps maintain hygiene because it washes the oil and dirt out from the skin pores ensuring that the skin and hair have a healthy shine and glow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":62634,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wordpress.ghanatalksradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drinking-Warm-Water.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62634\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr Adefarati Ajayi, another medical practitioner emphasized that hot water not only restores body temperature but also prevents headaches, this is because, during the rainy season, high humidity can trigger headaches, especially in children, so having a hot water bath will help prevent this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other benefits of hot water especially in the wet season include burning calories as a recent study conducted by Loughborough University on the effect of hot baths suggests. Hot water baths also moisturize the skin as the warm water leaves the skin moist for longer and more receptive to skin vitamins when applied. Hot baths also help us feel better and more relaxed after a stressful day. It is also a great way to reduce daily anxiety as well and makes us feel good all around.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":62635,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wordpress.ghanatalksradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/singing-in-the-shower.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62635\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Warm water has also proven useful in reducing mental stress as an immersion in a warm bath results in a reduction and balance in the nervous system activity. The combination of these effects may improve brain function with an increase in working memory, language skills and processing speed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So with the rains in season, a warm water bath has become an invaluable asset and quintessential to a healthy lifestyle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Therefore, it is imperative for families to invest and install water heater in their homes to navigate through this rainy season. Although some people consider water heater as a luxury, but recent studies have shown that quality water heater brands including Ariston, the world’s leading water heater brands are moderately priced.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":62636,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wordpress.ghanatalksradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/iStock-474235688.1-1024x795.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62636\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It has also been proven that buying and installing water heater in homes to provide hot water for bath and other purposes is far more cheaper at the long run that many other ways of heating water either using gas or stove. Water heaters are also safer when you compare with the hazards associated with boiling water in the kitchen and taking it to the bathroom, which could cause domestic accident.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

And in schools, it’s common to find children making Christmas ornaments from crepe paper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Christmas Eve, you can spot an outdoor parade, led by local musicians, in many of Ghana’s bigger cities.

In such occasions, you need to put your bags in front of you or at your side, secured firmly under your armpit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Move-in groups</strong>; This is really necessary, especially at night. First of all, we do not recommend you walking at night but if you absolutely must, you need to move in groups. In as much as it’s not all that safe, it’s better than walking about on your own. At least, now if one guy wants to “kwashey”(rob) you, because you’re in a group, it will be a little hard to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Check the number plate of the cars you sit in</strong>; This is applicable when using Ride-hailing services ( eg; Uber, Bolt and Yango), Taxi’s and VIP buses.

If you don’t too, you need to have Google Maps opened on your phone and following the route judiciously. If you don’t do these, it’s easy for you to be kidnapped. Even if the driver is passing a shortcut you need to be watching the road and make sure other cars are also passing there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Send other people your location</strong>; You need to let people close to you know where you’re headed so that if something bad happens it’s easier to track your whereabouts. Once you’re in a car, you can send your current location on Whatsapp to anyone you trust.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Be observant</strong>; You need to keep checking your surroundings. Keep watching. No one is really your friend on the streets so mind your own business and keep walking or doing whatever it is you went out to do. If you feel like the vibe where you are isn’t okay, please LEAVE immediately. Trust your gut.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Make sure you have small denominations</strong>; </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To have peace of mind, carry smaller denominations of money.

The cold rain for one can make body temperatures unstable by causing hypothermia which occurs when the body gets cold and loses heat faster than the body can make it. The rainy season also brings with it respiratory diseases such as cold and flu and results in fluctuations in body temperature and it was for these reasons, that we were made to bath in hot water or at the very least, soak our wet cold feet in it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":62632,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wordpress.ghanatalksradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/inline_image_preview.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62632\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many benefits of warm water during the rainy season, one of these is that drinking warm water soothes nasal and throat congestion while removing phlegm from the respiratory tract.

Drinking warm water removes congestion in the chest as nasal congestion is a common occurrence in the wet season of the rain, warm water also helps to flush out the mucus in the air passage and lungs giving a soothing relief from sinus and sore throat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":62633,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wordpress.ghanatalksradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hot-drink-next-to-stove-top-kettle-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-62633\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When mixed with coffee and teas, hot water has many benefits.

Hot water baths also moisturize the skin as the warm water leaves the skin moist for longer and more receptive to skin vitamins when applied. Hot baths also help us feel better and more relaxed after a stressful day.

Don't over-stir - think of theseas folded eggs rather than scrambled. The eggs should have the texture of soft curds. It's best not to cook more than three portions in one go as you will overcrowd the pan and the eggs won't cook as well.

Airlines have had to reduce their capacity due to travel restrictions and health and safety measures, resulting in fewer flights and higher prices.

Additionally, the cost of fuel has increased due to the pandemic, which has also contributed to higher flight costs.
